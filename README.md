# How I Passed AWS Certification
Hello Connection üë©‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíª

I have been asked several times on what I studied to pass my AWS exams.

I studied using St√©phane Maarek solutions architect for my associates. I proceeded to doing practical test using Whizlabs solution architect and Jon Bonso .

The best time to schedule your exams , is when you started passing practical tests by 80%.

Least I forget, Adrian Cantrill has one of the best AWS devOps course.

I hope this helps those that are looking to take their AWS solution architect exams decides on where to start.

If you‚Äôre looking to write AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02 & SAA-C03), I recommend you check Adrian Cantrill & St√©phane Maarek , they have one of the best lectures out there.

And for practical test, I recommend Whizlabs & Jon Bonso


All the best to those taking their exams üëèüëèüëèüëè


HAPPY LEARNING üìå
